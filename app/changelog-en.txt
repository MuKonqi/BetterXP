    The window size is now set by the value in the code: This has improved the beauty by allowing for gaps.

    "Settings" is the new name.
    The interface has been redone from scratch.

    "About" and the interface has been improved.

    If the installed version is different from the one on the internet, the newest version is now there.
Improvements have been made to the text:
    Fixed some translation errors for English.
    Removed phrases like "shutting down", removed output to console.
Removed things like shutdown buttons (why do you need them when you have a cross key)

    Other and Flatpak' section.
"Opening apps with root rights" edited:
    "Open file managers with root rights".

Reset feature added.
Update, Reset, Uninstall now uses the v2.0 version of the Apiutaller wizard, thanks to my reinstallation addition and some improvements.

Added error when running with root rights on modules that may break functionality.
Added information about the distribution used in the distributions section to the main page.
Changes were made to the filenames of some modules.
Updated the text in README.md and BENÄ°OKU.md files.
Improvements were made to the code.

Internet:
    MetterXP's own website:
        Currently closed as I don't think it's needed and Jekyll has been causing problems in some distributions I've been using lately.
    Added: MetterXP wiki
        The most necessary thing was the help section, which is now available on the wiki.
